HANNA extends the [Matterport3D simulator](https://github.com/peteanderson80/Matterport3DSimulator). It is easiest to setup on our pre-configured Docker image. If you want to setup with Docker, please make sure the following tools have been installed:
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [nvidia-docker 2.0](https://github.com/nvidia/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0))

You can also install HANNA without Docker (similar to [installing the Matterport3D simulator without Docker](https://github.com/peteanderson80/Matterport3DSimulator#building-without-docker)) but it would be complicated to resolve the dependency requirements!
